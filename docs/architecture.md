# Architecture

The app exists to deliver a fast, replayable general-knowledge trivia experience on mobile. It spans seven subjects (geography, history, science and nature, arts and literature, sports, entertainment, general knowledge), each split into subcategories. The design prioritizes instant load and offline play: all content is pulled once per language as a snapshot, cached on-device, and served from local storage thereafter. Progress, currency, and gamification state live entirely on the device — there is no user account or server-side profile.

## Navigation

Expo Router provides file-based routing with a single `Stack` navigator defined in `app/_layout.tsx`. The initial route is `splash`. A first launch flows splash → language → onboarding → home; returning users land on home directly. Most screens hide their header and ride a hardcoded dark purple gradient. Back gestures are disabled on flow screens (splash, language, onboarding, paywall, quiz, results) so the player cannot swipe out mid-flow or back into a finished quiz.

| Route | Screen | Role |
|-------|--------|------|
| `splash` | Splash | Animated intro; routes onward by first-launch flags |
| `language` | Language | Locale picker (en, ru, es) |
| `onboarding` | Onboarding | One-time intro carousel |
| `index` | Home | Hub with Categories and Modes tabs plus the bottom bar |
| `category/[slug]` | Category | Lists a subject's subcategories |
| `quiz-mode/[slug]` | Quiz Mode | Per-subcategory question count and mode picker |
| `quiz` | Quiz | Gameplay: question card, hints, lives, timer |
| `results` | Results | Score, accuracy, achievement unlocks |
| `stats` | Stats | Career totals and achievement progress |
| `shop` | Shop | Lives and hint bundles (RevenueCat on Android; local-grant fallback elsewhere) |
| `account` | Account | Sign-up/login UI (not wired to a backend) |
| `settings` | Settings | Language, dark mode, reset, legal links |
| `paywall` | Paywall | Premium pitch; tapping a locked mode lands here |

The bottom bar (`components/bottom-bar.tsx`) links home, stats, shop, account, and settings, and hides itself on the quiz and results screens.

## State and Context

Three React context providers wrap the whole tree, in this order: `LocaleProvider`, `PremiumProvider`, `ContentCacheProvider`. They are ordered so each can depend on the one above it — content sync keys off the active locale, for example.

- **`LocaleProvider`** (`hooks/use-locale.ts`) tracks the active language, whether the user has explicitly picked one, and the supported set (`en`, `ru`, `es`). It seeds from the device locale and falls back to English.
- **`PremiumProvider`** (`hooks/use-premium.ts`) holds a single `isPremium` flag, hydrated from storage. On Android device builds it also syncs (upgrade-only) from the live RevenueCat `premium` entitlement so returning subscribers stay premium without re-purchasing. Billing runs through RevenueCat / Google Play (`lib/revenuecat.ts`, initialized via a side-effect import in `app/_layout.tsx` mirroring Sentry).
- **`ContentCacheProvider`** (`hooks/use-content-cache.ts`) owns the offline snapshot — categories, subcategories, questions, and locally downloaded images — plus a sync status and 0..1 progress value. See [Content and Offline](content-and-offline.md).

Quiz gameplay state is local to the quiz screen via `useQuizSession` (`hooks/use-quiz-session.ts`), a `useReducer` state machine. See [Quiz Flow](quiz-flow.md).

## Key Design Decisions

**Offline-first content.** Rather than fetch questions per session, the app downloads the full content snapshot for the active language once and caches it for 24 hours, images included. Quizzes then draw from the cached pool, so play works on a flaky or absent connection. The live `questions/random` and `categories` endpoints remain as fallbacks when the snapshot is unavailable.

**Device-local progress.** Stats, lives, hints, mistakes, achievements, and the premium flag all live in AsyncStorage. This keeps the app accountless and private, at the cost of progress not syncing across devices. The account screen exists for a future backend but is not connected.

**Slug-keyed visuals with DB override.** Each category and subcategory renders an icon. The API now serves `icon_emoji` and `icon_url` per category, but the app keeps a hardcoded fallback map (`constants/category-visuals.ts`) so a brand-new or unsynced category still shows a sensible icon and gradient. The DB value wins when present; the map is the safety net. See [Data Model](data-model.md#category-icons).

**Reducer-based quiz session.** The single linear quiz is a `useReducer` machine rather than a state library — its transitions are few and well defined, so a reducer fits without extra dependencies.

**Premium as a soft gate.** Three modes are always free; the rest show a crown and route to the paywall when tapped without premium. Gating stays a client-side flag; on Android it is backed by the live RevenueCat `premium` entitlement (synced upgrade-only on launch), while Expo Go / web / iOS keep the local flag as the source of truth.
